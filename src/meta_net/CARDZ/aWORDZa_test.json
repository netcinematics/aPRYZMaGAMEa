So many disclarities in our words.\r\n\r\nAnd current humanity is observably_not_aware of widespread confuzion\r\n\r\nilluzion, and non_visible cloudy_concepts. \r\n\r\n> Without_words, we are all unable to speak of actual_reality, as it actually_exists.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we are observably_not_aware of the GRAVITY of Affect_&_Effect of ACTZ\r\nof encouragement or discouragement - either grow a healthy society - or a toxic one.\r\n\r\n> We_are_observably_unaware_of_many_things\r\n\r\n### HOW TO SOLVE the HUMAN_ENIGMA\r\n\r\nFirst, look for All_Concepts_UnderConsidered.\r\n\r\nIt was a very lucky coincidence that SOCIAL_PHRASES turned out to be important.\r\n\r\nAnd exactly the way, that METADATA can be applied to the WORDS in common phrases...\r\nillustrates the human_enigma.\r\n\r\nBecause it is clear, that what we say, and what we mean - is always unclear!\r\n\r\nBetween WORDZ and CONCEPTZ is a very important unexplored place of non_visible_viewz\r\n \r\nwe_need_hold_focus, on non_visible_viewz of non_visible_conceptz.\r\n\r\n> AllHumanzLook, do not dismiss so quickly!\r\n\r\n> AllHumanzLook, seek out maximum clarity of viewz!\r\n\r\nYou have one_time_in_one_body to explore existence.\r\n\r\nWhy not maximize understanding of everything?\r\n\r\nWhy maximize money, or leisure, or pleasure... over wizdom?\r\n\r\n> A major part of human_enigma, is the inescapable_exhaustion required to view it, and to avoid it.\r\n\r\nThe crushing confusion of all society is inescapable. \r\n\r\nSo heavy a burden, that most minds give up to pursue pleasure instantly.\r\n\r\nBut what of our species, for the mind who choozes to think deeply?\r\n\r\n> A most noble of all efforts, is to convey clarity - to a seeking mind.\r\n\r\n> While a most tragic of all efforts, is to convey confuzion - to a curious mind.\r\n\r\n### The Human_Enigma is vexing beyond belief.\r\n\r\nIt literally scrambles the focus, with too many concepts.\r\n\r\nInto near instant overload_&_overwhelm. We experience focus_loss \r\n\r\nand become wrongly_afraid. Instead of learning, some flee public persecution?\r\n\r\n### aPRYZMa\r\n\r\nThe analalogy of a PRYZM is essential in looking at human_enigma.\r\n\r\nBecause it replicates the separation between CONCEPTS, VIEWZ, WORDZ and actual_reality well.\r\n\r\nJust like a CRYSTAL PRYSM, we have a_PRYZM_of_VIEWz\r\n\r\n> 1) Between our eye and actual reality, exists a_crystal_view - called `~aPRYZMaVIEWZa~`\r\n\r\n> 2) Crystal_Viewz can be cloudy_or_clear, focused_or_unfocused, actual_or_disactual.\r\n\r\n> 3) Observably, all_human_mind interprets viewz as actual_reality\r\n\r\n> 4) Often, our aPRYZMaVIEWZa are actually_clear - we feel rightfully_confident.\r\n\r\n> 5) Often, our aPRYAMaVIEWZa are actually_confuzed, and we feel wrongly_afraid.\r\n\r\n> 6) With great surprise, on the entire aPRYZMa - distortions are actual.\r\n\r\n> 7) The fantasy is real... when in our minds. All_fantasy_exists_in_mind.\r\n\r\n> 8) Sometimes we rightfully_defend_aFacta, \r\n\r\n> 9) Sometimes we_wrongfully_defend_aFalza,\r\n\r\n> 10) Sometimes we_retaliate_when_wrong,\r\n\r\n> 11) The affect_or_effect of aPRYZMaVIEWZa is like a sunami on all_human_mind.\r\n\r\n> 12) ~ACTZ~ regulates our experiences as good or bad.\r\n\r\n> 13) ~ACTZ~ regulates our actual_awareness of clarity_or_confuzion\r\n\r\n> 14) ~ACTZ~ regulates our actual_extra_intelligence or actual_limit_intelligence\r\n\r\n\r\nSo aPRYZMaVIEWZa is a clear view, of CONCEPTZ, with CLARITY_or_DISTORTION.\r\n\r\nUsually a_clarity_in_center or distortion_around_edge.\r\n\r\nHistorically, all_human_mind is observably_perplexed by all_human_confuzion,\r\nand or actually_unaware of limit_of_all_human_intelligence, into all_human_illuzion.\r\n\r\nThese WAVEZ of relative_clarity to relative_confuzion, up to deep_illuzion, \r\nfluctuate through all_human_mind, from generation_to_generation, across all_time.\r\nJust like concepts_flow_from_mind_to_mind in all_society.\r\n\r\nIf the social_structure is actually_wrong, then the citizens show symptoms_reflective of the type of discouragement - of having to witness and endure actual_wrongness.\r\n\r\nSo this is a major part of the PRYZM analogy. Of Reflections and Refractions, in addition to clarity or distortion. And sometimes.. the PRYZM blocks your view entirely of actual_reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### CLEARER_DEFINITION\r\n\r\nTrying to put into words, the viewz of conceptz, that historically resist being put into wordz - for very good reason.\r\n\r\nWe_can_see confuzion as it exists in a structure of mind.\r\n\r\nObservably, a mind that can only focus on one concept, is going to experience and cauze \r\nconfuzion for all other viewz outside of that focus.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be the non_vizible_ghost_of_mind that humanity, apparently fights against unaware, for thousands of years, and is still silently in place - as of writing.\r\n\r\n> The_Human_Enigma, is a non_vizible, multi-faceted structure, of conceptz, between our viewz of actual_reality, for all_human_mind, where the only evidence or ability to map its outline - is our words.\r\n\r\n## a_Linguistic_Study_of_aHumanaEnigma\r\n\r\n`~aHumanaEnigma~`\r\n-  is a_complex_combination of:\r\n- focuz and conceptz and viewz, and actz, impulz and choize, and goalz.\r\n- measured_by_wordz\r\n\r\nhuman_enigma feels like a massive pending force of discouragement, because it is in fact, \r\nthe result of all_human_confuzion, the actual_mental_limit, where concepts exist beyond actual_human_comprehension. \r\n\r\n> Any CONCEPT, that is not understood, by any mind - begins a complex_continuum, of affect_or_effect_actz, that cascade through society, in \"countless ways\" - that we can NOW COUNT!\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the TAXONOMY_and_ONTOLOGY of all_human_actz, as measured_by_wordz.\r\n\r\nTrying to put into words, a_perfected_clarity, is actually_daunting and actually_overwhelming, \r\nbecauze it will take more than this_one_body - to deduce_the_human_enigma. And worse, hope is so quickly_lost at the INABILITY to affect_or_effect POSITIVE_CHANGE. Hope is so quickly_lost at the vastness_of_challenge, and the actual_enormity_of_confusion. That is is reasonable by_nature, for all_human_mind, to say - there is in actual_reality nothing_to_do. Where in, is also - a_quiet_persistence_of_wrongness. And actual_hopelessness.\r\n\r\nBut hope_lost_is_returned, when the following is REALIZED to HOLD_in_FOCUS:\r\n\r\n1) the wrongness of all_human_confuzion, is not worthless, or scary, but is ESSENTIAL_to_LEARN.\r\n\r\n2) the SOLUTION_to_all_human_confuzion, is unbelieveably, always the same. It is wordz.\r\n\r\n3) so if, an antidote_to_all_human_confuzion is alwayz_wordz, then realize we simply need to seek_better_wordz, to focus_awareness.\r\n\r\n4) So the SOLUTION_of_all_human_enigma - is actual_better_wordz!\r\n\r\n5) And thus, aWORDZa is - a PRACTICE of wrapping words around aPRYZMaVIEWZa.\r\n\r\n6) So PRACTICE_a_relentless_process, of seek_better_wordz. \r\n\r\n7) To SEE the massive_monolith_of_pending_confuzion\r\n\r\n\r\n### non_vizible_social_wavez\r\n\r\nIt appears, when seen, as actual_massive_LENZ over all_human_viewz, in affect_and_effect_to_all_actz.\r\n\r\nAll_human_actz, actually governed by non visible forces. non_magic. \r\n\r\nExactly_where, the fantasy_exists_only_in_minds.\r\n\r\n### non_vizible_forcez\r\n\r\nAll_non_visible_forces_can_exist_in_wordz, some do exist_in_words, some exist actually_beyond_words,\r\nand the most important of all is concepts_of_spark_into_wordz.\r\n\r\n> The road to viewz of actual_reality, has historically been exceptionally bumpy - for all_human_mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this actual_human_theatre, actual_human_charade, and actual_human_facade - can be deduced, \r\nthe enigma can be visualized. From_words_to_wordz_with_aWORDZa. A mechanism, with the purpose to \r\nspark_viewz_of_actual_reality and arrive at reflectionz_of_actual_reality. Then the method is to aWORDaCRAFTa, with actual_better_words - concepts_beyond_us_no_longer_beyond_us.\r\n\r\n> The non_visible_forcez, can be visualized in 3D maps.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLE_of_BOTH aEnanDis\r\n\r\n> an actual mistake in human view, on \"positive and negative\" - it is actually_flawed_social_concept.\r\n\r\n> \"positive and negative\" is a_bogus_concept.\r\n\r\nAnd it blocks our minds from viewz of actual_reality.\r\n\r\nAround 2010, an important discovery was made - unjustly_rejected_by_all_minds who view it, and \r\nrefuse_to_view it - but known_for_certain, by the first_witness to exist_as_actual.\r\nApart from exist_as_fantasy. The view was aMATRIXofaENandaDISa\r\n\r\nIt was found via SOCIAL_PHRASES. \r\n\r\nWe are confused about \"positive\" and \"negative\". Why? Because there are 2 INVERSIONS - observable to all, but actually seen by very few.\r\n\r\nThe TWO EXACT INVERSIONZ of ACTZ that appears to be in a blindspot for current_human_mind is when:\r\n\r\n1) something good is discouraged.\r\n\r\n2) something bad is encouraged.\r\n\r\nThese ACTZ fall beneath the radar of \"positivity\" and \"negativity\" because the CONCEPTZ of a_positive_and_negative is actually incomplete. a_partial_afalza. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears as if, the human mind has an OVERWHELM point, at which the brain stops evaluating,\r\nand forgets past context, memorizing only what is presented - in solo_focus. And then,\r\nat later date, the triggering of that is quite obvious. With the parrallel rejection of concept\r\nat the same time. \r\n\r\nSo it is this SOLO_FOCUS_FACTOR that tops out minds of peers, reviewers - and experts. \r\nTo actually silence concepts - not based on correctness - but on \"positivity\" or \"negativity\"\r\nActually rejecting - to what is memorized - not to freshly_evaluated_viewz.\r\n\r\nApparently unaware_of_AFFECT_EFFECT. Only of the solo_focus_in_mind.\r\nAnd this is how, We_act_apart_from_actual_reality. Such actz_confuze_all_minds.\r\nAnd we exist in a state of ongoing befuddlement. Where no one really knows how to untangle_the_knots_in_minds. So the CONCEPTS and VIEWZ must go silent, for a time, and often become aTaboo. Actual good people, punished by generations, of misguided peers. Merely reflecting society, not upon the concepts as they exist in actual reality. That is the unavoidable knot_in_all_human_mind - the_human_enigma_unresolved. byNature.\r\n\r\nBecause if the concept exceeds our ability to evaluate it - then we are left with a binary_option.\r\nAccept_or_Reject. Where half the time we choose correctly, and half the time wrongly.\r\n\r\nThis is the genesis of the MATRIX_of_EN_and_DIS as first visualized in 2010.\r\n\r\nEncouragement of good - is \"positivity\". And,\r\n\r\nDiscouragment of bad - is \"negativity\"\r\n\r\nBut there are also two inversions... often overlooked, where the choice is actually wrong.\r\n\r\n1) REJECT_CONCEPTS that are actual_reality GOOD_VIEWZ (but BAD for some - inverzion), \r\n\r\n2) ACCEPT_CONCEPTS that are actual_flawed BAD_VIEWZ (but GOOD for some - inverzion).\r\n\r\n- the point is, this is an example of a_COMMON_CONFUZION.\r\n\r\nCurrent Human Mind appears to be commonly confused and under-educated on existence of encouragement and discouragement, as opposed to actual_positivity_and_negativity_flawz.\r\n\r\nWHY? The inarticualation, clouds or blocks us from choozing correctly (often).\r\n\r\nThat INVERSION of \"positive and negative\" ACTS, gets all_human_mind observably confused, on a consistent basis.\r\n\r\nIt is the mechanism_of_abandoned_evaluation. \r\n\r\nactual_evaluation replaced by automated_responses.\r\n\r\nis a mechanism_for_social_trauma, and apparently a blindspot_of_all_human_mind.\r\n\r\nThe MECHANISM_for_GENERATIONAL_SOCIAL_TRAUMA appears to be around a focus_overwhelm occurring in the \r\nevaluation of GOOD_or_BAD.\r\n\r\nAs long as we focus on solo_concepts to the exclusion of encouragement, we must always see good_concepts_unjustly_rejected. And actually_flawed_concepts_unjustly_accepted - with longterm consequences of BOTH INVERZIONS.\r\n\r\nThat appears to be partly the cauze for current_social_discouragement.\r\n\r\n### Deep Definitions of ACTZ and CHOIZE and SEEK.\r\n\r\nWhat cannot be explained visibly, is the non_visible process of all_human_mind, except through words.\r\n\r\nThe CONCEPTS show up beneath our words. Reveal the differences between minds, that we are yet_to_articulate.\r\n\r\nObservations,\r\n\r\n the CHOICEZ we make, AFFECT_EFFECT our ACTZ.\r\n\r\n and our ACTZ, AFFECT_EFFECT, all other mindz.\r\n\r\n which is an AFFECT_EFFECT on SOCIAL_CHOICEZ.\r\n\r\n which is an AFFECT_EFFECT on SOCIAL_CHOICEZ_of_ACTZ.\r\n\r\n It is circular and cyclical, and is the SOCIO_WAVEZ that stitch, all_human_fabric.\r\n\r\nBut, allhumanzLook, if the focus_factor is too high for all_human_mind to comprehend,\r\nthen eons of unawareness exist byNature. There is in fact, sparks of awareness, at random, all around the world, like lightning bolts strike the earth - so to reflections_of_actual_reality_spark_to_mind.\r\n\r\nThat is called `~aSPARKa~`.  The random minding evaluating actual_reality, while resisting the automatic_repetition, and unjust_rejection, of actual_social_choize.\r\n\r\nUp until the moment_of_aSPARKa, and after, there are specific ACTZ (remarkable / clarified actionz), that are necessary for aSPARKa to EXIST. Just like a campfire needs exact composition to be effective. So too, the mind requires precise composition of ENCOURAGING ACTIONS in SOCIETY, so as to create and continue sparks of actual awareness - else all actz are silently_suffocated_in_aDARKa every time.\r\n\r\n> `~aSPARKaDARKa~` - everytime, except: where one_mine_sees_anew. Where one_mind_sparks_aware.\r\n\r\nElse, all existance is actually_dark alwayz. Dark physically until a star illuminates the dust.\r\n\r\nDark conceptially until a mind reflects on actual_reality, illuminated in light.\r\n\r\nAnd then that actual_spark_of_mind, has actual_social_actz in result, alwayz.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the ACTZ required to start and hold aSPARKa.\r\n\r\n- aFOCOa, aCURIOa, aQUERIOa, aSEEKa, aWIZDOa and aENa.\r\n\r\nStill, with all these tools, a machete is needed to constantly cut the mis-information back.\r\n\r\nWe are lucky to assume that forced mis-information is relatively sparse and spartan.\r\n\r\nExcept, it is infact among us in massive systemic ways. Less than we think.\r\n\r\nThe concepts that are most automated, are also the ones, most potentially corrupted on initial input. Also the least likely to adjust, while looking_through_pryzm. A reinforcement of shame and fear.\r\nUsing emotions to buttress (wrongly_encourage) the actz of self-shame and self-fear or self-guilt.\r\nLike a pollution in the water, but this is from your peers. actual_peer_polution.\r\n`~actual_conceptual_pollution~`.\r\n\r\nAnd if your society, who so completly surrounds you, all believes in ghosts, the wavez of viewz, and actz, of choize, and focuz, aCurio or aDisCurio, aQuerio or aDisQuerio, and aSEEKya and aENa and aDISa. \r\n\r\nThe experiences are highly-predictable. And measurable.\r\n\r\nIt is astounding, how often the root_cauze of sadness is ignored, and only the sadness treated.\r\n\r\nIt is almost as if we have given up evaluating, even before the question appears, and when the questions arises - at instant turn again, and again - to the exact same elixir, of previously memorized concepts, with mixed results - but never a review of the concept itself! And when, dear humanz, over time, this was tested again and again - a reasonable pleading with another mind to evaluate an unjustly_rejected_view - a distinct pattern of behavior arises. We_double_up_rejection. We respond with ever increasing escalation_of_retaliation. Ironically, exact_opposite of ACTZ_of_aENa. Observably non_curious, and non_querious, and non_evaluative. Observably aChoize_of_aDissa or `~aCHOOZEaDISSa~`.\r\n\r\nThe system is observably flawed, but we are all also helpless to fix it, so hapless as may be, we are forced to continue on - until someone puts the flaws into words_clear_enough for most_to_favor. And worse, the cynicizm is popular now. Almost as if a response to recent years of hope and change, a dark wave of stubborn disjustice rises to meet it. An observable epic_divergence_of_exact_opposites, these two existences, or aSparkaDarka, we see threaded into all_existence of universe.\r\n\r\n## The `~Fabric_of_all_humanity~` and the `~Fabric_of_all_existence~`\r\n\r\nNew insight and new innovation all most alwayz correlate with new words, because it is actually the words (many times) that lead the innovation into creation. Like an ugly inch worm sheds its skin to become a beautiful bug that can fly, so too innovations an insights arise when minds are cooking with new words.\r\n\r\nThe critics of creating new words - do no benefit to confuzion, while suppressing new thoughts.\r\nWho is at fault for suppressing new thoughts?\r\n\r\n### Necessary to SOLVE\r\n\r\n> anymind can guess at the distortions in the cracked mirror, but save_a_few_minds who diligently seek_to_know exactly the contours of the illuzion, restlessly and relentlessly, a curious and questioning nature of actual_seek_to_know mind will fight_for_clarity just as some minds fight_for_closure.\r\n\r\naSEEKa -  is necessary active_ingredient to solve_all_human_enigma, of why we do what we do, and how we chooze to do it.\r\n\r\n> If a mind is surrounded by minds_who_chooze_to_guess, or minds_who_chooze_to_not_know, or minds_who_pretend_aKnowa - it is reasonable that most minds will be asimilated_to_society.\r\n\r\nBut one mind, looks the exact opposite view of all concurrent opinion, to the the opinions of various actual_flaw, like cracked glass, and upon investigation find conclusively - the expert never actually evaluated or articulated, at depth, all_concepts_beneath_words. But instead repeated the answers of before, just like the_telephone_game, with deceasing fidelity over the years.\r\n\r\nUntil someone is required, by this dis_force_of_disinterest, to summon an en_force_of_interest. \r\nAnd look at what existence actually is, and compare it (honestly) to the unjust_repetitive_diatribe.\r\n\r\nAnd where present, every significanly aware mind - must see the same viewz. In someway yetArticulated, society is somehow twisted. `~aTWISTaWIZDOa~`. We_cannot_see. And society cooks up all possible guesses, where only a few rhyme_with_existence or reflect_actual_reality. And we can guess as to the transforms within the pryzm. And we can fight_about_what_is_real. But also, we can decipher the entire puzzle - of actual_reality -  precisely. By using a system like aWORDZa.\r\nBy enhanced_and_advanced_linguistics\r\n\r\n> common misconceptions are buried in words, and words are the soil for each generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for a plant to depart from the toxicity in the soil which it grows, or from the plumes of polluted air flows, or shrink from intense solar rays that shine down - without dying.\r\n\r\nThe plants must injest poison to survive, up until the point - that poison fully chokes off growth.\r\n\r\nThe poison and the darkness are the same.
