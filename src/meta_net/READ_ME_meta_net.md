## PURPOSE

The LIBZ folder contains any random source of MARKDOWN, HTML, or TXT files, as a search source.
The SCRIPTZ folder contains JS scripts to run that search LIBZ and produce output in CARDZ and TXTZ
The CARDZ folder contains JSON objects of meta_data for card views.
The TXTZ folder contains JSON objects of text_data for txt views.

These files are directly served from raw github pages. A node server was previously available for this type of routing on the backend, but given significant grief to deploy on vercel, and fragility of networks over time, it was realized that raw self-service in (singular) gh-pages dependency would be most likely to last longest in production.
