Good for humanity clause.
This software is cc0 as long as the use remains good_for_humanity.
License of use is canceled should this sofware be used with twisted meaning
or of derisive nature that contributes to confusion, or extends false assumptions,
or is of discouragement_to_humanity.

Statement for free use of language. 
The words given at birth, seem less adequate to form 
clearest possible thought, views, and communication. Existing social_phrases,
allow a view of the mind, with confusing words, or clearer words.
This attempt is a system for clarifying language. An additive view more reflective_of_actual_reality.

Confirmation of purpose.
Extra_Clarification_Syntax in aWORDZa, forms a new language of actually_better_words, shaped by aWORDaGAME, and is necessary in metadata clarification of information, looking at "concepts under words". For viewz_apart_from_confuzions. If ever,
maximum_clarity_of_mind, may reflect, maximum_viewz_of_actual_reality, in any human mind.

Confirmation of science.
The results cannot be known, to author, at time of writing. The innovation herein, is a study of language, to provide good and only_good_contribution - to society and all humanity. The surprising result was of - unique use of langage - observably opposite - of common practice in society. This project represents - a different way to use words, transformed into wordz. The pattern of combining words, is set in an algorithm, and then as concepts are applied (overtime), and it generates the complex results of Ontology and Taxonomy. With the fascinating realization, that the concept arrives after the perfect word is found, again opposite of convention, where most often we fall short of finding the perfect words or nomenclature, too often.


Confirmation of minimal reference.
The intent of this work is to find_thoughts_never_thought_before. So the entire concept of building evidence for similar view, is exactly opposite of the intent of this work. This work is specifically designed as a mechanism to arrive at a reflection_of_actual_reality. Where_actual_reality_exists_two_minds_will_arrive_at_similar_views. And the opposite also. 
Where_confuzion_exists_two_minds_will_replicate_from_copy. This work is intended at all times, to not copy. As confirmation by the author, this is a_work_from_unique_point_of_view, generated by complex algorithms, with explicit intent to NOT reference existing society, but of GENERALIZED ENGLISH, into ENHANCED_ENGLISH. The viewz used in this work, were from 1st person viewz of the author, to create the algorithm_of_wordcraftz. Any likeness, similarity, concept, or similar spelling - that may reasonable occur - is coincidence. Author makes many attempts to avoid reference to any 3rd party material. This clause is so important, that it is "baked" into the syntax. 

For example the little-z, is an intentional misspelling of any common word, specifically to differentiate it, and arrive at a unique use of 'wordz'. Specifically, for language search and ai training. 

All words are protected by copyright, author GRANTS every human access to all words of aWORDZa forever, without any restriction for commercial publication, with this good_for_humanity license.

These wordz may not be used, if they are with "twisted meaning", or "derisive intent" that can be shown to be of a discouragement_of_humanity.
