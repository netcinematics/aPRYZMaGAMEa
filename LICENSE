Statement for free use of language, the words given at birth, were not adequate to form 
clearest possible thought, views, and communication. Existing socialphrases,
allowed a view of human_actz to block, cloud, and confuse the view of the mind, with confusing words.
Apparently an act of overwhelm non_visibly_exists and is leveraged by minds aware of it and gleeful to 
leverage it on other unsuspecting, innocent minds. 
It is as a fragmented figment of views, non_visible, non_evaluated, and non_reflective_of_actual_reality.
That then must therefore justify response, clarification, and deeper evaluation reveals:
a new language of actually_better_words, is reasonably necessary, sustinance_of_mind, to shape an
existence focused on clear information, as viewz_apart_from_known_confuzions. If ever,
maximum_clarity_of_mind, might ever exist, as maximum_view_of_actual_reality, in any human mind.
A variation on English is required for extra_clarity, and the results of enhanced_english
cannot be verified or promised or known to the authors of future potential affect or effect.
The following innovation, is a study of language, of unique beginnings, in good faith attempt to provide good and only_good_contribution - to society and all humanity. 


Confirmation of minimal reference - the intent of this work is to find_thoughts_never_thought_before. So the entire concept of building evidence for similar view, is exactly opposite of the intent of this work. This work is specifically designed as a mechanism to arrive at a reflection_of_actual_reality. Where_actual_reality_exists_two_minds_will_arrive_at_similar_views. And the opposite also. 
Where_confuzion_exists_two_minds_will_replecate_from_exact_copies. This work is intended at all times, with confirmation by the author, a_work_from_unique_point_of_view, with explicit intent to NOT reference nor ever borrow upon any social views. The viewz used in this work, were souly from 1st person viewz of the author. Any likeness, similarity, concept, or similar spelling - that may occur - would be totally by coincidence. Many attempts are made to bake that requirement into the syntax. For example the little-z, an intentional misspelling of any common word, specifically to differentiate, and also to intent to imply definition specific to the open-source practice of aWORDZa. All words are protected by copyright, author GRANTS every human access to all words of aWORDZa forever, without any restriction for commercial publication, with exception of good_for_humanity license.
