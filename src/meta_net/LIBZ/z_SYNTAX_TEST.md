## How to create tokenz???

It is not that easy to invent a system to slice and dice txt such as this.

> tokenz do not create themselves.~

Captivating STORY of people to love and hate.

## PROBLEM_of_PUBLISHING

A decade was spent looking for an appropriate place to publish this digital content.

> The ability to create this experience is possible.  

> While, the ability to deliver it to the world, remains oddly impossible. ~

How to get eyeballs to the web? Seems odd that that is a problem, given that the web is world wide afterall. The barren wasteland in cyberspace exists, apparently, because everyone was distracted away. Intentionally.

So, since no market can be found - create the market. After perfecting the rich_digital_artform,

and a rich_digital_art_pipeline, so too a rich_digital_art_market... was necessary to build.

### INFINITE SOLUTION

> The biggest problems with any publishing environment is - will it exist forever?~

Paperback books can be burned. And Platforms of Social Media can go out of business.

BLOCKCHAIN delivers on that promise (except) many 3rd party providers become fail_point_intermediaries.

So what is the best solution for infinite publishing? GitHub.

a single source of existence, that can then be copied... to exist forever.

That is how. That is best. That is the point.

## aSTORYBOOKaWORDZa

> The storybook of WORDZ, is a mezmorizing innovation, and amazing human invention. ~

### syntax_of_quotes

> If there is another quote back to back, what happens?~

> Seems to work well.~

# SYNTAX_RULES for quotes

1) single quotes as greater than sign
2) asterisk sign ends quotes, enables multiline
3) also must have clear line to end quote in md

## understanding advanced parsing

Half way through the most advanced parts, some things are becoming clear.
There needs to be a "generative" build of many views of the same src document.
Then those views are used by different tools, when needed.
Example: KEY_INDEX used by main_menu, and QUOTES, used by QUOTE VIEW.
There is a tricky problem of wrapping the end points up correctly.
Going backward to populate metadata is unusual.
For example quotes should contain the SIG and YMD of the document, but the algorithm may not know about SIG and YMD until the end. So either it runs a SIG and YMD check first (for current document).
Or it can go backwards and tag context retrospectively, or both. Tricky.

## UNIVERSAL_UNDERSCORE

The universal_underscore_syntax is an interesting concept, to simplify TOKEN_KEYS, INDEXING, LINKING, and TRAINING. Any word with a leading underscore is a primary key, and any word with an underscore after the first letter is a secondary key.
