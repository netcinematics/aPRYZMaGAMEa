## What is aWORDZa?

aWordza is a WORD_GAME, designed to solve the ai problem of GENERATING articulated_context_metadata for large language models.

goalz_: to generate_better_words, and concepts_underneath_words, with a new and improved SYNTAX and NAMING CONVENTION, for a unique and reliable source of ai training.

### _aWORDaGAMEa_

pronounced_: ah-word-ah-GAHM-eee, like oragami.

meanz_: A game of wordcrafting. Like actual word oragami. 

aliaz_: aWORDaGAME, word_game, actual_word_game, actual_act_of_word_games, awordagamea.

~~~

aWORDaGAME_Challenge meanz_: convert wordz to more accurately describe actual_reality, in as few characters as possible.

~~~

## How to play aWORDaGAMEa?

Start by exploring in any direction. 

> Literally, any_viewz_you_CHOOZE is a_good_start.

Pick any of the wordz, and start pulling on that thread... called seeking. 

Basically, you start by start_seeking_clues.

> actually_chooze_to_seek_awordza.

This prime_concept, is called _aSEEKa_, which meanz: actual_actz_of_seeking. And can be further described as _aSEEKaWORDZa_, meanz: actual_actz_of_seeking_articulated_wordz.

> We_all_choose_to_seek_some_things. 

1. So we start, at whatever it is, that you_chooze_to_seek!

We_all_aChoozeaSeeka.

---

2. Then, use all wordz possible, around your focus, to construct _aVIEWZa_.

Begin listening to all words, and transform them into CONZEPTZ_beneath_WORDZ.

> seek concepts that you have never thought before.

~~~

With the advanced version of aWORDaGAMEa to_: Seek_conceptz_no_human_mind_has_ever_thought_before.

~~~

_aSEEKa_ alias_: aSeeka_Conceptas_BeyondUs

> Look_into_questions_that_all_human_minds_overlook.

3. Practice_Actual_Focus

4. then aPRYZMaGAMEa, and aSYMBOLza.

That's the high level overview! 

> aWORDZa is an ai wordgame, first used to rhyme song lyrics.

## INTO aWORDZa

aWordza helps apply words to concepts, in a general way. 

It has many principles to most simply, structure vast arrays of text with topics.

Here are a few principles.

### aWordza Principle_of_fewest_letters_and_words

> The goal is to maximize concept articulation, with the fewest characters possible.

### Example Gameplay:

1. As soon as you find a_new_concept, that did not previously exist in your mind,

2. use aBetterWordza to simplify its name. Often combining words, while keeping it:
      - brief,
      - self-descriptive,
      - memorable

3. And as you find aBetterWordz later, quickly adapt to aBetteraWordza.

    It's not as easy as you may think. Here it becomes and infinitely_complex_word_puzzle.

4. Notice how well WORDZ_combine to create aWORDaGAMEa.

That is where the real fun is! Exciting and rapid. It is important. And it appears to be a very rare in the ACTZ of all_human_mind. Something quite remarkable.

> Use aWORDZa to, look_and_see, through aPRYZMaVIEWZ of actual_reality.

It is tremendously fulfilling to experience.

### How does is work?

aWordza uses a simplified_language_syntax, called _Enhanced_English_. 

It is more flexible, and robust, to combine words, and articulate_conceptz_exactly - for yet_to_be_well_named_concepts. 

Major aspects of language were improved, with subtle (minor) syntax and naming convention alterations.

Future_wordz, will detail the many design principles applied elegantly, to ENHANCE_HUMAN_LANGUAGE to maximum level for use in new tools in language expression. 


> Where a goal is to fold_wordz_like_oragami, until we arrive at, better_meta_data, and if we are lucky, a_clearer_reflection_of_actual_reality.

- From a technical standpoint, aWORDZa is just a loop over words, with a system that describes them exactly in metadata. 

- From a design standpoint - it is like a_GAME_of_WORDZ. 

Following the SIMPLIFIED_LANGUAGE_SYNTAX (naming-convention) 

- aWordza is a_WORD_GAME of playing aWORDaGAMEa within aPRYZMaWORDZa.

> use artificial intelligence to decipher actual_reality, into actual_intelligence. !i!

conzeptz_await_us, and aWORDZa folds them into existence - as a game.

### Origin Story

The original intent of aWordza was to provide meta_context for rock and roll song lyrics! Then the search was to create STORY within EDM MUSIC VIDEOS.

As far back as 2002, this was common endeavor in _ai. But also, this approach was a unique perspective of artistry and word-crafting. The many scripts and syntax, and tokenizers - morphed, or evolved into an ongoing aWORDaGAMEa.

# GAME_of_aWORDZa

The PRIME_GOAL is to:

1. SEEK-METADATA, for ALL-WORDS, as if SONG-LYRICS.

2. Then compare those song lyrics together in abstract ways.

> aWORDZa is an easy puzzle to learn, and infinitely difficult to master!

## PRINCIPLES_of_aWORDZa

principz_:

1. **a_self_descriptiveness**, means: All META-DATA needs to be all_human_self_descriptive. Where, all_human_mind should be able to read wordz and understand simultaneously max degree, with minimum aConfuzion.

2. **a_syntax_conciseness**, meanz: all META-DATA needs to be human_concise_syntax meanz: short and brief, while also exact and specific.

3. **Memorable, flexible, and Organic**, meanz: it should be effortless to learn, and flexibly fit into everyday life, without causing word_overwhelm, or expression_dillema.

4. **Infinitely Combinable** meanz: it automatically adapts all_conzeptz_yet_to_be_seen. As soon as you see any new concept, aWORDZa simplified_syntax is all ready, to define aBetterWordza.

Overall, the game is to identify - the clearest possible articulations - of actual_reality, and apply them in max_human_readable_form.

# SYNTAX of aWORDZa

The SLS (simplified_language_syntax), reduces the complexity_of_english.
With remarkably few characters!

1. UNIVERSAL_UNDERSCORE, meanz: a single character to define all metadata. Underscore wrapped words meanz: PRIME_KEY. Underscores internally, are called sub_key. 

GOALZ_: most_human_readable and most_human_memorable, and most_human_usable!!!

2. ALPHA_KEYZ, are in the camel-case format of aWORDZa.

Wrapped inbetween two little-a's. The little_a_prefix, meanz: 'actual' giving a way to articulate wordz specific to actual_reality. Like,  ActuReality, meanz: actual_reality.

> Apart from aDisActualReality exists aEnActualReality

3. ACTZ is the little_a_postfix. Like a NOUN, it defines all_human_actions

4. **z-miss-spelling**, meanz: enhanced, articulated, or remarkable. And its primary purpose is to reliably make common_words_unique, for ability to define exactness again.

## CONCLUSIONS

Give it a try. Chooze to study aWORDZa. Start combining wordz. And experience JOY in the discovery of all_that_exists. Beyond_your_mind, and beyond_all_human_mind. Use aWORDaGAMEa to define many viewz, and experience the thrill_of_discovery, as words become WORDZ and concepts generatively_reflect_actureality.

nJoy!!!
