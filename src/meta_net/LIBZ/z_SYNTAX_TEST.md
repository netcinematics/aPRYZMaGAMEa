## PROBLEM of PUBLISHING

A decade was spent looking for an appropriate place to publish this digital content.

The ability to create this experience is possible.  

> The ability to deliver it to the world, remains oddly impossible. 

How to get eyeballs to the web? Seems odd that that is a problem, given that the web is world wide afterall. The barren wasteland in cyberspace exists, apparently, because everyone was distracted away. Intentionally.

So, since no market can be found - create the market. After perfecting the rich_digital_artform,

and a rich_digital_art_pipeline, so too a rich_digital_art_market... was necessary to build.

### INFINITE SOLUTION

>> The biggest problems with any publishing environment is - will it exist forever?

Paperback books can be burned. And Platforms of Social Media can go out of business.

BLOCKCHAIN delivers on that promise (except) many 3rd party providers become fail_point_intermediaries.

So what is the best solution for infinite publishing? GitHub.

a single source of existence, that can then be copied... to exist forever.

That is how. That is best. That is the point.
