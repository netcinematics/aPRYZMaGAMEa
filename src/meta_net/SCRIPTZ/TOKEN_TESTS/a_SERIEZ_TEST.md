# 1.0 a seriez example

here is a series of numbered points:

1. a single hash at the top will populate all text until 3 tildes end the topic.

2. The main topics are numbered and subtopics numbered into _NUMZ_.

> a Quote randomly in a seriez.

3. The hashes remain to distinguish type or importance, but they display flat.

4. and do not need nesting, because they are dynamically_linked, not_nested.

and some other text.

then whatever texts are inbetween become a text token. AllHumanzLook DearHumanz

5. non dropoff: picks up series again.

even completely isolated txt_tokenz are ok.

## 1.1 main topics and sub topics

main topics and sub topics, defined by single hash or multiple hash.

1. markdown is nested, but we do not need (or want) nesting.
2. because it is unnecessary. 
3. Instead we use hash to indicate start topic 
4. and 3 dashes to indicate end topic. 

aWORDZa. And EXISTZ. Or ACTZ.

- flat_no_nesting
- random bullet points
- as conclusion

and then more text.

> Third quote at end

### 1.2 flat structure of _NUMZ_

> quote 4

1. Each entry is numbered by a unique system of NUMZ 
2. where a dynamic key is generated between runs. 
3. Counting ALL TOKENZ sorted by key and subkey, 
4. and using the length of each token array as sub topic counter - on push.

#### 1.3 NUMZ details

NUMZ are strings of random dot delimited numbers. A random number of sequence by type given at mint time.
The randomness is where it is fed into the system. Otherwise it is generating a unique number - when combined with the mint_stamp.
