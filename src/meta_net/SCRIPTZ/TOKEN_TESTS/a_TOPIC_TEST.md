# 1.0 a topic test

used to test how topics are tokenized. With description of parsing principles.

> main line quote

---

## 1.1 PARSING PRINCIPLES

> a key quote on the topic.

flat_no_nesting, end_line is semicolon, triple_dash and triple_tilde are examples.

> a second engaging quote

---

### 1.2 a seriez example

here is a series of numbered points:

1. a single hash at the top will populate all text until 3 tildes end the topic.

2. The main topics are numbered and subtopics numbered into _NUMZ_.

3. The hashes remain to distinguish type or importance, but they display flat.

4. and do not need nesting, because they are dynamically_linked, not_nested.

and some other text.

then whatever texts are inbetween become a text token. AllHumanzLook DearHumanz

5. And pick it up again.

---

even completely isolated txt_tokenz are ok.

---

> an isolated quote is ok.

## 1.3 main topics and sub topics

main topics and sub topics, defined by single hash or multiple hash.

markdown is nested, but we do not need (or want) nesting.
because it is unnecessary. Instead we use hash to indicate start topic and 3 dashes to indicate end topic. aWORDZa. And EXISTZ. Or ACTZ.

flat_no_nesting

### 1.4 flat structure of _NUMZ_

Each entry is numbered by a unique system of NUMZ where a dynamic key is generated 
between runs. Counting ALL TOKENZ sorted by key and subkey, 
and using the length of each token array as sub topic counter - on push.

#### 1.5 NUMZ details

NUMZ are strings of random dot delimited numbers. A random number of sequence by type given at mint time.
The randomness is where it is fed into the system. Otherwise it is generating a unique number - when combined with the mint_stamp. 

#### 1.6 _MINT_STAMP_ details

the mint_stamp is a unique runtime key, generated on the day the program is run.
Which can be used to compare differences between run sets.

### 1.7 SUB TOPIC SEARCH SET

To have many sub topics , have a title with many triple dashes.

1. numbers and bullet points should be 
2. done manually.
3. for example bullet points 

- It would be cool 
- to make these
- dynamic bullet point symbols

### 1.8 ERROR HANDLING

if a triple_hyphen end is not found the titles are combined

all the way up until triple_tilde

~~~

This content is a subtxt

~~~

A return from triple tilde
I wonder how this content will be formated

It is formatted as a quote. what in the world?

~~~

beautiful either way - looks like triple_tilde is a comment out - into code (opposite world) lolz.

Or it seem better that triple_tilde be sub section identifier.

So hash it top of group, divided by triple_dash and triple_tilde. wow.

~~~

## 1.9 END_OF_file

do not have a sign for end_of_file, let it just close all the existing open tokens.

# 2.0 single hash starts a new topic

that are then

---

delimited by multiple new topics
