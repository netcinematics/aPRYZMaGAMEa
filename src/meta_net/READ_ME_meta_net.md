## PURPOSE

The LIBZ folder contains any random source of MARKDOWN, HTML, or TXT files, as a search source.
The SCRIPTZ folder contains JS scripts to run that search LIBZ and produce output in CARDZ and TXTZ
The CARDZ folder contains JSON objects of meta_data for card views.
The TXTZ folder contains JSON objects of text_data for txt views.

These files are directly served from raw github pages. A node server was previously available for this type of routing on the backend, but given significant grief to deploy on vercel, and fragility of networks over time, it was realized that raw self-service in (singular) gh-pages dependency would be most likely to last longest in production.

# ALGORITHMS

X first-class-function architecture for standard_tokenizer to advanced_tokenizer
X add version tag to output
X add timestamp tag to output
X add key
X add txtz only - no txt, txt become type.
X replace ~ tilde wrap with single underscore _aWordza
X end of quote is a tilde.

X line_end replace by ;
X script numerator_1 _2 naming
X date folder DATA/tokenz_YMD_2023_7_26

X continue for every token
X output each array as build step
X endline rollup by watcher index and fn.
X mint_token_factory()
X add reduced /TOKEN_TEST/ file.md
X add TOPICZ and SUBSETZ
X MAINTOPIC and SUBTOPIC s
X remove empty section top/bottom


X finish QUOTE: write_all_quotes. end_line.
X finish SIG, DATE, write_all.
X finish SERIEZ: numz,
X NUMZ on seriez, txt, and quotez
X item drop off check.
X add NUMZ
X ENDZ_KEY
X MIXCASE_KEY
X UNIVERSAL_KEY
X PRIME_KEY
X total_token_count
X 4 star to triple_exclaim !!! key_conzept
X inline YMD search, and push.
X All key tokenz avoid SIG_ and YMD_

X finish TXTZ separate repopulation as KEY_CARDZ. 
X all txtz that contain key. cross-reference-idx.

X write txt_tgt to card.txtz, push numz
X search for PRIME_KEYS for card header. origin



X key aliases across key_types.
X cardz lookup, key_conzeptz, 
X confirm cardz hold all_quotez
X write all txt hitz to cardz
X remove duplicate keys


O txt objects in txtz cardz, why? keyz as linkz on txt

O test across all test files
O remove test mode
O open up multiple files.
O write to file for all keys (read all keys)
O show txt_tgt below with meta.linkz

O random colors for keys
