## What is aWORDZa?

aWordza is a software tool, to generatively_articulate_metadata. With a practice to generate_better_words, and concepts_underneath_words, for metadata abstraction comparison. As a NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING engine from ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

### aWORDaGAME

pronounced: ah-word-ah-GAHM-eee, like oragami.

meanz: actual word oragami.


## How to play aWORDZa?

Start by exploring in any direction. Literally, any word you aCHOOZE is a_good_start.

> you actually_chooze_to_seek_awordza.

This concept, is called aSEEKa, which meanz: actual_actz_of_seeking. And can be further articulated as aSEEKaWORDZa, meanz: actual_actz_of_seeking_articulated_wordz

> We all choose to seek something. We_all_aChoozeaSeeka.

Begin listening to all words, and transform them into WORDZ in your mind.

> seek concepts that you have never thought before.

And then the advanced version of the game is to

> Seek_conceptz_no_human_mind_has_ever_thought_before.

Or in short, _aSeekaConceptzaBeyondUs_

> Look_into_questions_that_all_human_minds_overlook.

And that's how it works!

## INTRO to aWORDZa

aWordza helps apply words to concepts, in a general way. 

Any mind can Look_for_missing_words, or look_for_concepts_actually_beyond_us. 
We just have to practice_focus. We just have to chooze. We just have to play a game of combining words together - until they best_reflect_actual_reality.
If we_chooze_to_look, anyone_can_see - extra_conceptz_exist_in_all_directions.

> aWORDZa is a systematic method of linguistics, to automatically name and organize, all concepts that could possibly exist, for_all_time.

As an engine that can accellerate in the direction of separating clarification from confuzion and actual_extra_intelligence, by defining exactly, a_nature_of_misinformation.

### Example Gameplay:

1. As soon as you find a_new_concept, that did not previously exist in your mind,

2. use aBetterWordza to simplify its name. Often combining words, while keeping it:
      - brief,
      - self-descriptive,
      - memorable

3. And as you find aBetterWordz later, quickly adapt to aBetterWordza.

    It's not as easy as you may think. Here it becomes and infinitely_complex_word_puzzle.

4. Notice how well WORDZ_combine to create aWORDaGAMEa.

That is where the real fun is! Exciting and rapid. It is important. And it appears to be a very rare in the ACTZ of all_human_mind. Something quite remarkable.

> Use aWORDZa to, look_and_see, through aPRYZMaVIEWZ of actual_reality.

It is tremendously fulfilling to experience.

### How does is work?

aWordza has a simplified_language_syntax, compared to English. It is more flexible, and more robust, to combine words together. There are many DESIGN_PRINCIPLES applied elegantly, to try ENHANCE_HUMAN_LANGUAGE to maximum level using tools. 

- From a technical standpoint, aWORDZa is just a loop over all words, and then a system for describing them exactly. 

- From a design standpoint - it is a_GAME_of_WORDZ. 

Following the SIMPLIFIED_LANGUAGE_SYNTAX (naming-convention) - a_WORD_GAME of playing aWORDaGAMEa through aPRYZMaWORDZa.

Where the PRIME_GOAL is clearest_reflection_of_actual_reality.

### Origin Story

The original intent of aWordza was to provide meta_context for rock and roll song lyrics! Then the search was to create STORY within EDM MUSIC VIDEOS.

As far back as 2002, this was common endeavor in _ai. But also, this approach was a unique perspective of artistry and word-crafting. The many scripts and syntax, and tokenizers - morphed, or evolved into an ongoing aWORDaGAMEa.

# GAME_of_aWORDZa

The PRIME_GOAL is to:

1. SEEK-METADATA, for ALL-WORDS, as if SONG-LYRICS.

2. Then compare those song lyrics together in abstract ways.

> aWORDZa is an easy puzzle to learn, and infinitely difficult to master!

## PRINCIPLES_of_aWORDZa

1. **a_self_descriptiveness**, means: All META-DATA needs to be all_human_self_descriptive. Where, all_human_mind should be able to read wordz and understand simultaneously max degree, with minimum aConfuzion.

2. **a_syntax_conciseness**, meanz: all META-DATA needs to be human_concise_syntax meanz: short and brief, while also exact and specific.

3. **Memorable, flexible, and Organic**, meanz: it should be effortless to learn, and flexibly fit into everyday life, without causing word_overwhelm, or expression_dillema.

4. **Infinitely Combinable** meanz: it automatically adapts all_conzeptz_yet_to_be_seen. As soon as you see any new concept, aWORDZa simplified_syntax is all ready, to define aBetterWordza.

Overall, the game is to identify - the clearest possible articulations - of actual_reality, and apply them in max_human_readable_form.

# SYNTAX of aWORDZa

The SLS (simplified_language_syntax), reduces the complexity_of_english.
With remarkably few characters!

1. **UNIVERSAL_UNDERSCORE**, meanz: a single character to define all metadata. Underscore wrapped words meanz: _PRIME_KEY_. Underscores internally, are called sub_key. 

GOALZ: most_human_readable and most_human_memorable, and most_human_usable.

2. **ALPHA_KEYZ**, are in the format of aWORDZa.

Wrapped inbetween two little-a's. The little_a_prefix, meanz: 'actual' giving a way to articulate wordz specific to actual_reality. Like,  _ActuReality_, meanz: actual_reality.

> Apart from aDisActualReality exists aEnActualReality

3. **ACTZ** is the little_a_postfix. Like a NOUN, it defines all_human_actions

4. **z-miss-spelling**, meanz: enhanced, articulated, or remarkable. And its primary purpose is to reliably make common_words_unique, for ability to define exactness again.

## CONCLUSIONS

Give it a try. Chooze to study aWORDZa. Start combining wordz. And experience JOY in the discovery of all_that_exists. Beyond_your_mind, and beyond_all_human_mind. Use aWORDaGAMEa to define many viewz, and experience the thrill_of_discovery, as words become WORDZ and concepts generatively_reflect_actureality.
