# _aENa_

Actual actz of encouraging affect_or_effect.

---

So rare in current culture, aENa is whispered as a legendary wizdom of the ancient greats. Thin like a scent in the wind, for all_human_mind, within the air currents that flow over earth - and through time.

> The truth is all minds are forced to guess from time_to_time. 

`~aENa~` as the actual actz of encouragement, says to continue guessing until reality is reflected upon, rather than to stop guessing for fear of failure.

Two exact_opposites, exist_by_nature, `~aENanDis~`, and they govern all_actz and all_impressionz.
